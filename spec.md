## Requirements

x The code should be written in ES6 as much as possible

x Use the `create-react-app` generator to start your project.
	- Follow the instructions on this repo to setup the generator: [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

x Your app should have one HTML page to render your react-redux application

x There should be 2 container components

x There should be 5 stateless components

x There should be 3 routes

x The Application must make use of `react-router` and proper RESTful routing 
    - (should you choose to use react-router v3 please refer to the appropriate [docs](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/v3/docs); docs for v4 can be found [here](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start))

x Use Redux middleware to respond to and modify state change

x Make use of async actions and `redux-thunk` middleware to send data to and receive data from a server

x Your Rails API should handle the data persistence with a database. 
    - You should be using `fetch()` within your actions to GET and POST data from your API - do not use jQuery methods.

x Your client-side application should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation

x Your application should have some minimal styling: feel free to stick to a framework (like react-bootstrap), but if you want to write (additional) CSS yourself, go for it!

- [Once your app is complete, fill out this checklist.](https://goo.gl/forms/ULtKsxuzWomvXuTk2)
