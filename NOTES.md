*Pets*

Spirulina (Sheba) the Tiger Princess 
My little shadow- you are part of me.

Terrapin the Queen
She ended up being my kitty- and I am so thankful to have had her in my life. Such a sweet girl.

Weston the beloved stinky hound
He was a fragrant boy but was always down to play catch. His favorite tennis ball would be so soggy, but you would pick it up because his adorable face made you do it.

Pinchi Pescado the grumpy fish
This guy was a character- if you got too close to his tank he would splash you!

Rex the hunter
A tomcat who ruled the neighborhood. He was loved by all but one. Unfortunately it was this one who did him in. Rest in peace.

Hot Wheels the iguana
He was a sassy guy who ended up getting too big for me to handle. I'm glad we found a better home for you little guy!


*Memories*

Tankie
Happy little hopper
You made me laugh so hard then and still to this day at how you bunny hopped over the train tracks whenever we went to the Bay.

Pizza Party
I can't believe you let me put sunglasses on you- how adorable! We really enjoyed eating pizza and drinking beer on the patio with you. Too bad this place is gone now.

A good one
Every day with you was a good one in some way.

Starry night
The beach is our favorite place and even though at first you were afraid of the dark, when your paws touched the sand you were right at home.

Gone swimming
We tried out your lifejacket for the first time and you had so much fun! I can't believe how brave you are.

Terrapin
Thank you for being such a sweet girl and for giving me my kitty princess who I cared for until she went to see you 20 years after you gave her life.
